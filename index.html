        <li>Sales data is gathered by using backpack.tf's inventory comparison tool: compare someone's inventory the day before a sale to the day after and you can easily see the sale. (see the compare links in the suggestion)
        <li>Once sale data has been gathered, a price range is determined after excluding outlier sales. In the example suggestion, I excluded sales at 16, 17,21 (too low) and 33, 36 and 38 (too high). Outlier determination follow statistical methods</li>
